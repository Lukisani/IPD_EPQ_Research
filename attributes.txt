Niceness:
    1: Never defects first
    0.5: Conditionally defects first / First to defect even if unprovoked (but not on first move)
    0: Unconditionally defects first / Defects on first move

Forgiveness:
    1: Forgives after 1 defection
    0.5: Forgives conditionally after several defections
    0: Never Forgives

Memory depth:
    n: n indicates the number of prior moves the strategy considers before deciding on a move
